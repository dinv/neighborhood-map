## Features
This application displays a few of the Target locations in the metro Denver area.  Address information via API is supplied when the locations are clicked, and the sidebar can be minimized for a larger view of the map.  Searching for locations filters both the list in the sidebar, as well as the visible markers.

## APIs
This app utilizes Google Maps in conjunction with the Foursquare API to display basic address information. The APIs are called asynchronusly, and basic error handling is implemented.

## Running the application
Clone or download this repo and open `index.html`
